  HOW DUZ I SQRT X
    I HAS A X_N ITZ 10
    I HAS A LIMIT ITZ 100
    I HAS A COUNTER ITZ 0
    IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR COUNTER WILE COUNTER SMALLR THAN LIMIT
      I HAS A TERM ITZ QUOSHUNT OF X AN X_N
      TERM R SUM OF X_N AN TERM
      TERM R QUOSHUNT OF TERM AN 2
      X_N R TERM
    IM OUTTA YR LOOP
    FOUND YR X_N
  IF U SAY SO

  I HAS A AC
  GIMMEH AC
  AC IS NOW A NUMBR
  BOTH SAEM AC AN 0, O RLY?
